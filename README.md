Snake–Water–Gun Game (Python)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Snake–Water–Gun game.
The same problem is solved using two different approaches:

1. snake_water_gun_short.py
   - A concise implementation with minimal logic

2. snake_water_gun_detailed.py
   - A more readable implementation with explicit control flow and input handling

This project was created to compare coding styles and strengthen logical
problem-solving skills using Python.
